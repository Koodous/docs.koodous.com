The Koodous app is on its way to Google Play. In the meantime, let us point out its main features:

The app will behave in one out of two ways depending if it has been linked with the user's Koodous web account or not.

## Detect fraudulent apps

Using Yara rules and the votes of the Koodous community, the app can establish if there are fraudulent applications installed on your device. Our application will cross your installed apps with the Koodous database, warning you if any of the applications in your device is tagged as a fraud.
