# Hands on

## Introduction

Koodous is a collaborative tool


## My God, it's full of apps

We provide you literally millions of apks to download and analyze. The repository is constantly being updated with new packages from several sources, both official and unofficial. And here comes the best part: it's totally for free. Yeah, we feel generous.

## Analyze by your rules

We love Yara rules, so we thought you could find them useful too. You can write your own rulesets and launch them against any APK of your choice, or maybe just sit back and relax. Our analysis system will apply you rules to every fresh uploaded APK and reach you when a match shows up. 

## Get social

The voting and commeting systems in every package screen let you share your findings about any APK with the rest of the community. 

What if I like the rulesets that other analyst did? Don't worry, you won't have to do all that copy n' paste. Just follow him and automagically you will be warned when an APK gives a positive for his rules. Awesome, right?

## Koodous finest

If the community find your rulesets useful you will accumulate followers and eventually reach the Top 25 Koodous users. If you receive such honor, your will be part of the chosen ones that stablish the reputation of the APKs for the mobile application. This means your rules will help people to be safe, as they will be warned if a app installed in their phones or tablets match your rules.

## Or go solo

In the case you prefer not to be affected by the social rulesets, just can link your phone or tablet with you account using our QR Code method. And voil√°! The APKs in your device will only be analysed using your rulesets. This is pretty useful when you are investigating a installed APKand want a quick feedback about it using your own rules.
