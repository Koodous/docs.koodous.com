## Searching

In the repository screen you can search for any APK in the system. Depending of the fields, the search will return APKs with an exact or partial match:

#### Partial match fields

** App name
** Developer

#### Exact match fields

** SHA256
** SHA1
** MD5
** Package

When searching for a particular hash, you must enter _exactly_ the number of characters it has. This means that if you search for a partial hash, like 0bb9246deae4d3210e06791e9999c45 (notice the last character is left), the search engine will look in any partial match field, probably giving you no results at all. The search engine neither do partial searchs on package names.

At the moment there is no way to tell the search engine what are you looking for. So, if you look for a string i.e. Rockstar, you will have applications and developers which has this string somewhere in its name. 

## The detailed view

Entering on the detailed view of an APK is as easy as clicking over its name or SHA256 hash. Once inside, it is possible to see more information, vote it, write comments, request an analysis or download it.

The comment system is placed on a tab and is pretty straight-forward: write your findings or opinions and push Send. Just remember to be respectful with the rest of the community, do constructive critics and follow the standart netiquette. 

The up and down arrows on the right of the application image let you vote if that specific application is trustworthy or not. Please notice is not about how you like an application, but about how safe you think it is. 

You can download and send an analysis request using the specific buttons above the app image. 

### Info tabs

* The _General info_ tab shows a brief summary of the most identificative information. 
* Depending on the app, another _Metadata_ tab will appear showing a more complete report with information from Google Play, such as ratings and categories. 
* If the APK has been analysed, another _Analysis_ tab will show the report, also in json format.
