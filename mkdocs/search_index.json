Depending of the fields, the search will return APKs with an exact or partial match:\n\n\nRegular text search\n\n\nYou have the possibility to look for apks introducing text with no command at all. The entered text will be compared to the following fields:\n\n\n\n\nApp name\n\n\nDeveloper\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nHash (md5, sha1, sha256)\n\n\n\n\nFrom here you can use some little commands to exclude or add some options to your search.

You can either filter by tags, filesize, user's rating, ... For instance, if we can find applications with a rating less than -1 and from GooglePlay, you can use \nrating:\n=-1 tags:googleplay\n. This is useful to detect applications rated by users that maybe are not detected by any ruleset.\n\n\nAnother interesting search can be: \npackage_name:\"com.whatsapp\" -developer:\"WhatsApp Inc.\"\n\n\nThe following table describes each search modifier available, you can combine these as you can with the previous examples on regular text search section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nModificator\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\nrating:\n\n\nThis modificator is used to obtain application with certain users rating.

You can filter by this parameter with, for instance, for files greater or equal than 1MB: \nsize:\n1000000\n, or less than 700KB: \nsize:\n700000\n. Last but not least, you can use ranges (from 700kb to 1MB) \nsize:[700000 TO 1000000]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTag\n\n\ntags: (or tag:)\n\n\nWe tag the samples with interesting word and each user can set by one or more tag to any sample, and you can find for this.

With this module developed to be used with Yara, you can match applications by several criteria based on the static analysis.\n\n\nFirstly, you need to import the module with the next directive at the header of the ruleset.\n\n\nimport \nandroguard\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage name\n\n\nEach Android application has a package name that needs to be unique once the application is installed in the mobile phone, but in the wild, we find several applications with the same (or similar) package name. To find this kind of applications, we can use the next condition (we use a complete rule for explain the behaviour):\n\n\nandroguard.package_name(regex)\n\n\n\n\nAnd match with a string too...\n\n\nandroguard.package_name(string)\n\n\n\n\nrule videogames\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \nRule to catch APKs with package name match with videogame\n\n    condition:\n        androguard.package_name(/videogame/)\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou can add more restrictions to this rule, like strings, other functions of this module or conditions of another module.\n\n\nAPP name\n\n\nThe app name displayed when you install an application in a device could be an indicator of an \"anomaly\". For this reason, we have an condition to catch these applications.

They define the \"screens\" of an application and its logic, so, with the name of that, you can filter some applications. In the next example, we are going to filter applications which the name one of its activity is sms, with a point after and before of that word.\n\n\nIt accepts two formats, with string and with regular expressions:\n\n\nandroguard.activity(string)\n\n\n\n\nandroguard.activity(regex)\n\n\n\n\nAnd you must use in the conditions section:\n\n\nrule sendSMS\n{\n    condition:\n        androguard.activity(/\\.sms\\./) or\n        androguard.activity(\ncom.package.name.sendSMS\n)\n}\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this filter does not indicate that the application send SMSs, but maybe receive or use an screen to send some type of SMS.\n\n\nReceivers\n\n\nTo find applications with certain receivers you could use this to match:\n\n\nandroguard.receiver(string)\n\n\n\n\nandroguard.receiver(regex)\n\n\n\n\nAnd in a rule, inside condition:\n\n\nrule sendSMS\n{\n    condition:\n        androguard.receiver(\ncom.airpush.android.DeliveryReceiver\n) or\n        androguard.receiver(/smsreceiver/i)\n}\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nIn order to detect some applications that requires a special or desired permissions, you can use this condition. It find in all permissions of the application and if one of this match with the regular expression, it generates a notification.\n\n\nThe format is the next:\n\n\nandroguard.permission(regex)\n\n\n\n\nAnd you must use in the conditions section:\n\n\nrule videogames\n{\n    condition:\n        androguard.permission(/RESTART_PACKAGES/)\n}\n\n\n\n\nPermissions number\n\n\nSome applications with a huge number of permissions could be malware and this variable could help you to detect them.\n\n\nrule videogames\n{\n    condition:\n        androguard.permissions_number \n 5\n}\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\nThe service or services of an application are use to run tasks in background. Many times, the malware uses this to downloads configuration files, to send stolen data or another thing, ever in background. In order to detect the applications that use an special or desired service name, you can use this condition. It searches through all services of the application and if one of them matches with the regular expression or an exact string a notification will be generated.\n\n\nandroguard.service(regex)\n\n\n\n\nandroguard.service(string)\n\n\n\n\nAnd you must use in the conditions section:\n\n\nrule videogames\n{\n    condition:\n        androguard.service(\ncom.example.SendData\n) or\n        androguard.service(/receivetoken/)\n}\n\n\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nFilters of an application are used to detect broadcasts of itself or other apps. \n\n\nandroguard.filter(regex)\n\n\n\n\nandroguard.filter(string)\n\n\n\n\nAnd you must use in the conditions section:\n\n\nrule videogames\n{\n    condition:\n        androguard.filter(\nandroid.provider.Telephony.SMS_DELIVER\n)or\n        androguard.filter(/PACKAGE_ADDED/)\n}\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nIn our website, one of the details of each APK is the \"Developer\". If you are a malware analyst, you must know that this field is not easy to know, so we use the APK' certificate to extract it. If you encounter a series of APKs with the same Developer, you can create a Yara rule to know more of them.\n\n\nSHA1\n\n\nEach certificate has an SHA1 as a part of its signature, and you can match with it! Some malware developers use the same certificate for many samples, and with this condition you can detect them:\n\n\nandroguard.certificate.sha1(string)\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n that you need to match with the complete sha1, not with a part or regex of it.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nrule videogames: adware\n{\n    condition:\n        androguard.certificate.sha1(\n5C88CB801C4FB3D609B57DCD7CAFC25B35E03AC2\n) or\n        androguard.certificate.sha1(\n9E:E0:B6:FD:D1:DC:0A:2B:0C:6B:22:EB:C9:38:4C:A0:DD:05:12:D5\n)\n        /* Note that accepts two syntax, with and without colons */\n}\n\n\n\n\nIssuer\n\n\nThe issuer of a certificate is the person (or entity) that generate the certificate. With the next condition you can match with it:\n\n\nandroguard.certificate.issuer(regex)\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\n\nThe subject of a certificate is the owner of its. To match with this field, you can use:\n\n\nandroguard.certificate.subject(regex)\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Normally, Issuer and Subject in an APK' certificates are the same, but this is not a norm.\n\n\nURL\n\n\nWe perform an static analysis over the APK extracting the \nhardcored URLs\n. You can do a rule to match with that (using a regex or a string).\n\n\nandroguard.url(regex)\n\n\n\n\nandroguard.url(string)\n\n\n\n\nrule videogames: adware\n{\n    condition:\n        androguard.url(/adurl\\.com/) or\n        androguard.url(\ngoogle.com\n)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n: Remember that if you want to find a point (.) with a regex, you need to escape it with reverse slash. If you don't do that, it can match with any character.\n\n\nSDK versions\n\n\nThe AndroidManifest.xml file contains the versions minimum, maximum and target that the application requires, specified with the API number.\n\n\nThe API list is the next:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode name\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nAPI level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLollipop\n\n\n5.0\n\n\nAPI level 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKitKat\n\n\n4.4 - 4.4.4\n\n\nAPI level 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJelly Bean\n\n\n4.3.x\n\n\nAPI level 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJelly Bean\n\n\n4.2.x\n\n\nAPI level 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJelly Bean\n\n\n4.1.x\n\n\nAPI level 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce Cream Sandwich\n\n\n4.0.3 - 4.0.4\n\n\nAPI level 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce Cream Sandwich\n\n\n4.0.1 - 4.0.2\n\n\nAPI level 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoneycomb\n\n\n3.2.x\n\n\nAPI level 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoneycomb\n\n\n3.1\n\n\nAPI level 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoneycomb\n\n\n3.0\n\n\nAPI level 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGingerbread\n\n\n2.3.3 - 2.3.7\n\n\nAPI level 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGingerbread\n\n\n2.3 - 2.3.2\n\n\nAPI level 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFroyo\n\n\n2.2.x\n\n\nAPI level 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEclair\n\n\n2.1\n\n\nAPI level 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEclair\n\n\n2.0.1\n\n\nAPI level 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEclair\n\n\n2.0\n\n\nAPI level 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonut\n\n\n1.6\n\n\nAPI level 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCupcake\n\n\n1.5\n\n\nAPI level 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(no code name)\n\n\n1.1\n\n\nAPI level 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(no code name)\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nAPI level 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see an updated version of this table in its source: \nhttps://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html\n\n\nMin SDK\n\n\nMinimum SDK version specifies that, the minimum version of Android require to execute the application.
